1. What does the __runs-on__ string (do)?

The runs-on string tells GitHub actions which type of virtual machine to use. 
In main.yml, its configured to cs5500-self-hosted, meaning runners with that label
will be used to run jobs.

2. In `main.yml`, on which branch do the jest tests run when a push to main branch is made?

The tests run on the main branch. When a change is pushed to main, the workflow is triggered,
and actions/checkout@v3 checks out the code in main to run the tests against.

3. In `main.yml`, on which branch do the jest tests run when a pull request is submitted to the deploy branch?
The tests will run on the branch that is being merged into deploy. This allows testing of code changes before they are 
merged into the deploy branch.
